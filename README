    * Snake game to get more fluency programming in JavaScript.
    * The first two games I wrote I was learning googling and reading a lot.
    * After that I stopped writting code and started to study 
    * the book Javascript The Good Parts from Douglas Crockford. And when I
    * finished it, then I started to make this one, in a complete different 
    * way of coding. Just check the code of Space Invaders and then check this
    * one. I think this is more clean and professional, well documented following
    * JSDOC, and maybe using some of the best parts of this language.
    *
    * Current Status:
    * Playable. There are several bugs.
	*
	* ToDo
	* 路 Solve Insane speed (SOLVED)
	* 路 If you continue when you lose 3 lifes, the game continue forever
	*     like if you had infinite lives (SOLVED MORE OR LESS)
	* 路 Try to catch more accurately the arrows (CAN'T SOLVE IT RIGHT NOW)
	* 路 Show the Score and the lives.
